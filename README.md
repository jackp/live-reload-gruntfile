- Copy this `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` file to your project folder (if already have package.json, just add `grunt` and `grunt-contrib-watch` to your dev_dependencies
- Edit the `watch.livereload.files` array to your project paths that you want to watch
- From project folder, run `npm install`
- From project folder, in separate console tab run `grunt watch`
- Done
